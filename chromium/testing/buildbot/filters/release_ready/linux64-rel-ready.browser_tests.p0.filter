# TODO(crbug.com/1433395) Reword below requirement once green
# release is in production.
# This filter is for the P0 tests of Green Release, which must run
# and pass for the commit to create release tag.
#
# As of 23Q2, green release is still under development and below
# tests are picked up for experiments. Eventually, tests added
# here should:
# 1 complete in a reasonable time with little flakiness
# 2 map to a release outage or P0 issue
# 3 have clear ownership and SLO committed by the owners
